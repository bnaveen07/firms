## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|-----------|
| Frontend | React 18 + Redux Toolkit + RTK Query + Leaflet.js |
| Backend | Node.js 20 + Express.js 4 + Socket.IO 4 |
| Database | MongoDB Atlas (Mongoose ODM) |
| Auth | JWT + RBAC (admin / applicant / inspector) |
| Storage | Firebase Storage (photos, PDFs) |
| Hosting | Firebase Hosting (CDN) + GitHub Pages (frontend preview) |
| Functions | Firebase Cloud Functions |
| Notifications | Firebase FCM + Nodemailer |
| CI/CD | GitHub Actions |

## GitHub Pages Deployment

The frontend is automatically deployed to GitHub Pages on every push to `main`.

**Live URL**: `https://bnaveen07.github.io/firms`

To deploy manually:
```bash
cd client
npm run deploy   # runs predeploy (build) then gh-pages -d build
```

> **Note**: GitHub Pages hosts the static frontend only. The backend (Firebase Cloud Functions + MongoDB) must be separately deployed. See [SETUP.md](./SETUP.md) for the full production setup.

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/bnaveen07/firms.git
cd firms

# 2. Setup backend
cd functions
cp .env.example .env    # Edit with your values
npm install
npm run dev

# 3. Setup frontend (new terminal)
cd client
cp .env.local.example .env.local    # Edit with your Firebase config
npm install
npm start
```

See **[SETUP.md](./SETUP.md)** for the complete setup guide.
